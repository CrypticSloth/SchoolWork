###Control	4.2, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.6.1, and 4.6.2

#### 4.2. Explain each of the "dont't cares in Figure 4.18"

The MemtoReg field is irrelevant when the RegWrite signal is 0: since the register is not being written, the value of the data on the register data write port is not used.

#### 4.4.1. Which instructions fail to operate correctly if the MemToReg wire is stuck at 0?

ld will fail to work since the MemtoReg needs to be 1.

#### 4.4.2. Which instructions fail to operate correctly if the ALUSrc wire is stuck at 0?

both ld and st will fail to work since ALUSrc must be 1 for these instructions to work.

#### 4.6.1. What additional logic blocks, if any, are needed to add I-type instructions to the CPU shown in Figure 4.21? Add any necessary logic blocks to Figure 4.21 and explain their purpose.

The I-type instructions replace the rs2 and funct7 bits with an immediate value that takes up bits 20:31. Everything else is the same between I-type instructions and R-type instructions. For example, say we were going to implement the addi instruction. Instead of a "Read Register 2", we would take the immediate value and take it to an ALU where we would add the immediate value to the register in rs1 from the "Read Register 1". Then we would increment the PC. Therefore, there are no additional logic blocks added to the Figure to implement other than the data just going immediately to an ALU to be added. 

#### 4.6.2. List the values of the signals generated by the control unit for addi. Explain the reasoning for any "don't care" control signals.
