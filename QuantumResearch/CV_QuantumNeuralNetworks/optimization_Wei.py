# Your exercise is to use this code to build a quantum model to fit this linear dataset:
# x = [[0.1], [0.4], [0.6], [0.8]]
# y = [[0.2], [0.5], [0.7], [0.9]]
# Your first step is to write a classical Tensorflow program to approximate the value of y (y=0.1, or 0.5, 0r 0.9)
# then write a classical Tensorflow program to fit this dataset.
