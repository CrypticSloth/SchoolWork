<!-- Why reinforcement learning?
Why Neural Networks
Why Quantum Neural Networks? -->
<p>Quantum computing and machine learning are two exciting new fields. Quantum computing brings a new perspective on computers by using properties of quantum mechanics to do computations, which can be exponentially faster than the classical computers we know today. In fact, some tasks that we thought were impossible with computers today, can be accomplished using quantum computers. (CITATION) Machine learning is another exciting field that learns complex problems from large amounts of data that are too difficult for humans to manually solve. It been used in facial recognition (CITATION) and identifying weeds in precision agriculture (CITATION). A more recent sub-field of machine learning is <em>reinforcement learning</em>. Reinforcement learning uses a positive or negative reinforcement signal from an environment, known as the <em>reward</em>, to provide feedback to the learning system so that it may learn and improve to maximize this reward. Some fields that use reinforcement learning are in economics to artificial intelligence in games. (CITATION) Reinforcement learning is an attractive tool to use. While other machine learning techniques often times require a well tuned, large dataset to learn, reinforcement learning only requires a reward from an environment. This provides substantial control over the results of learning and saves time on finding and tuning a large dataset. Even further, we can use new quantum computing techniques to exponentially increase the power of these reinforcement learning techniques.</p>
