# Quantum Neural Network for Reinforcement Learning

#### Erik Sorensen
#### Data Science Honors Project Proposal

## Introduction
Why reinforcement learning?
Why Neural Networks
Why Quantum Neural Networks?

## Reinforcement learning
What is it? How is it used? How does it work? Why do we use it?

## Neural Networks
What is it? How is it used? How does it work? Why do we use it?

## Continuous Variable Quantum Computing
What is it? How is it used? How does it work? Why do we use it?

## Proposed Study
Here will go what we actually intend to do with these tools and why we chose to do what we did

##### Notes
Provide lots of examples on how each of these tools has benefited humanity in the past or how they can be used to make it more easily understandable.

Then Provide the math behind how it works at a high level.
