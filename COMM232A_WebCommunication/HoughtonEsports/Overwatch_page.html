        <!-- </div> -->
        <!-- <div class="grid-item-text"> -->
        <p> Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Overwatch
            assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from
            a roster of 30 characters, known as "heroes", each with a unique style
            of play whose roles are divided into three general categories that fit their role. These categories
            are Assault, Defence, and Support.
            Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort
            a payload across the map in a limited amount of time.

        <p> The 12 teams in our league play against each other during the regular season in best of 5 matchups.
            In other words, the first team to win 3 maps is the victor. Teams will
            play against each other and at the end of the season, the top 4 teams with
            the best record will go on to play in the playoffs, which will be a double
            elimination bracket hosted over one week at the victor school's stadium.
            These games are also best of 5, while the finals are a best of 7.
