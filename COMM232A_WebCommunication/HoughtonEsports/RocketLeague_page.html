        <!-- </div> -->
        <!-- <div class="grid-item-text"> -->
        <p>
            Rocket League is best described as soccer with cars. Rocket League
            is most commonly played in teams of 3, where each player drives a virtual car,
            and the goal of the game is to score the ball into the opponents goal
            while defending your own. The team who scores the most goals before the game ends wins. These
            cars however are somewhat special, as they can jump, roll, and sometimes
            even fly in the air. It is an extremely fast paced game that requires
            quick reflexes and even quicker decision making.
