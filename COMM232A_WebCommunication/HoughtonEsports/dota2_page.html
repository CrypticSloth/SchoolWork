            Dota 2 is a 5 v 5 MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. The goal of the game
            is to destroy the other the other team's 'Ancient', which is guarded by towers and
            the enemy team. To achieve this objective, players choose from over 110 different heros,
            each with their own unique abilities. Players use these heroes to then work together to
            destroy the enemy's Ancient.
