# Final Project 4 - Intro to Web Communication
## by Erik Sorensen

## Site Plan

This website is geared toward perpective students or others who would be interested
in Houghton College's esports program. While Houghton College does not currently have
an esports program, there are talks around getting something started here. I thought it would be a fun idea to explore what a website would look like if the esports program
was an actual thing here at Houghton.

The site strategy is to educate users what esports is and to provide more information
on what esports is at Houghton College, including the games that are supported and an
insight on how the esports league is run.
